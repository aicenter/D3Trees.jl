# D3 tree stuff

There is no simple API way of dynamically adding nodes to D3 hierarchy in versions above D3 v3:

- d3 hierarchy docs: <https://devdocs.io/d3~7/d3-hierarchy#treemap>
- Issue: <https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/issues/139>
- Question: <https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/issues/139>

So to migrate to d3 above version 3, some changes are required:

- when adding nodes with fetch, either:
  - update all parent nodes "height" as well as other params (probably preffered)
  - recalculate `hierarchy` for the whole data structure

This will probably not be too difficult, but I need to figure out some easier workflow with javascript. Its too slow to figure out what's going on when editing html files.

## Pannable tree

There is an example of d3 tree in v3 with pannable tree, something that seems to work really nicely and could be very useful when viewing deep trees:
